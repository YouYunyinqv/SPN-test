# Introduction

I believe that limited RL strategies cannot adapt to "infinite tasks" that truly meet AGI requirements. However, the conditions for the emergence of intelligence naturally exist within our physical structure, and they can be designed.
*In other words, I feel that nature does not prevent us from designing our own structure, and this structure can automatically exhibit our "general capabilities."*

My idea is that the Transformer's structural method of achieving a predictive drive is correct, but the artificial "simulation" of physical spacetime in other aspects prevents true intelligence from emerging.
For a mechanism like the Transformer that compresses features, the laws of thermodynamics do not prevent it from creating everything belonging to an agent within its own structure: "Self-boundary," "Endogenous drive," and "Infinite task requirements and self-planning capabilities matching infinite physical spacetime."
It just needs a little help, but we cannot interfere with the structure itself.
I have rethought everything from first principles and completed the framework loop.
This is a very long note, representing my thermodynamic logical thinking that has basically closed the loop.

I come from a chemistry background and cannot achieve the final overall falsification or proof, so I am seeking help here.

If you are interested, please continue reading:

# The Physical Premises of Intelligence
These parts are the major premises of this framework. If there are fundamental fallacies here, then everything that follows can be ignored:

1.  We cannot know the essence of things; we can only perceive a facet of them.
2.  We abstract the essence of matter as features. From our subjective perspective, features are hints of higher-level information.
3.  An object is only directly influenced by its **immediate neighborhood**, and there is an upper limit to the speed of information transmission.
4.  We (agents) cannot instantaneously obtain all information within the environment.
5.  Agents cannot obtain information out of thin air.
6.  Time is a single arrow; past information is irreversible. If it were reversible, time would flow backward.
7.  Due to the irreversibility of time and the limitations of locality, if an agent wants to obtain future information, it can only use its existing information to make predictions about another system. (Here, we temporarily disregard quantum mechanics.)
8.  Due to the lack of thermodynamic isolation, if an agent wants to acquire information within the environment, it will cause its internal information to be exposed and perceived by other agents.
9.  Under the limit of locality, if an agent can use the action of acquiring information to reach all accessible states within the other system, it implies that the internal information of the other party can be completely obtained by the agent. (This is a simplified statement; practically, it cannot be achieved, please focus on the physical core.)

# Implementing the Agent

## 1. Prediction / Predictability Impulse
We need an **Associator**.
The Associator is essentially a compressor that compresses information. It compresses features into high-dimensional representations and saves them within a limited material structure (storage space/RAM/or hard drive).
The compression process eventually leads to all information in the environment being compressed.

When all information in the environment is compressed, it means the environment is completely predictable.

### 1.1 The Associator's Perspective on Space / Spatial Path Minimalism
Observing the Associator within space.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help with thinking. They are not very serious, but they are useful:

*   *N*: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   P: Easier-to-predict feature P1, More unpredictable feature P2
*   S: Completely predictable feature S1, Unpredictable high-level feature S2

If a feature is predictable in high-dimensional features, we say it has obtained an "explanation" in the high-dimensional feature space.
When S1 is unpredictable, from the perspective of feature space P, the associability (or explainability) of S1 and S2 is averaged out; there is no significant difference.
When S1 is completely predictable, from the perspective of feature space P, the explainability of S1 begins to degrade, while the explainability of S2 conversely enhances.

For feature space N, the underlying feature spaces are all averaged.
The Associator cannot pursue the essence of features; it can only pursue the simplest explanation on the spatial path.

### 1.2 The Associator's Perspective on Time / Intelligence Time Optimization
Observing the Associator within time and space.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help with thinking:

*   *N*: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   P: Easier-to-predict feature P1, More unpredictable feature P2
*   S: Completely predictable feature S1, Unpredictable high-level feature S2

The S/P/N feature spaces we simulate in our brains essentially exist simultaneously in the environment. We subjectively believe they have a hierarchy, but to physics, they do not.
So:
*   The agent cannot instantaneously know all information in the environment.
*   There is an "observation window" for the information input acquired by the agent (no matter how far it can see, how rich the sensors are, or how many features it can feel, an observation window inevitably exists).
*   It simultaneously predicts all information within the "observation window."

So: In finite time, if the time from fully predicting S space to fully predicting P space is slower than the time from P space to N space, it forms low information gain and the perception of the agent's internal time.
To select the path with the maximum information gain, the agent is forced to choose spatial path minimalism.
To optimize intelligence time, the agent is also forced to choose spatial path minimalism; it cannot avoid it.

*   When the agent must choose a path with lower information gain and a more complex spatial path, the intelligence time difference itself will form an indescribable nausea. When intelligence time is optimal, the spatial path is simplest, and it is most predictable—when these three happen simultaneously, a complex "comfort" or "pleasure" should form.

However, here we actually assume by default that the agent can acquire information within the feature space hierarchically.
In reality, S, P, and N all exist within the environment, and only the intrinsic attributes of time and space are associable and progressive. The scarcity of intrinsic attributes of features makes the speed of the agent's prediction very tricky.
Therefore, if we place the agent in an environment with detailed material information (*rather than artificial semantic information*), we can discover:
If we can interfere with the features, we immediately achieve "1.1 Spatial Path Minimalism" and "1.2 Intelligence Time Optimization."

From a higher-level top-down logic, what we are doing is very simple; the agent has the idea to move, but it cannot move yet, so we provide help.
To realize this "if we can interfere with the features," we give the agent:

## 2. Action Changes Everything
In the sections above, we assumed the agent could interact with external spacetime.
But actually, it cannot.
Under the condition of passively accepting all information, among the S/P/N example spaces, only time and space are hierarchized. The agent is forced to accept all information. After predicting all information of S1 in S space, it exerts pressure on S2.
At this time, S2 becomes statistically significant. Since the feature space is continuous, S2 and P1 in the P space form Rs2p1, and the feature association set Rs2p1 exerts pressure on P2 again.

We place a "**Minimum Actuator**" after the Associator.
The Minimum Actuator is already the smallest non-omissible unit; if omitted, the "Dream" described later will collapse.
It is an executive device capable of interfering with spatial dimensions.

Once the Minimum Actuator is given, the low-level features subjective to the agent are inevitably interfered with. At this point, there are only two possibilities:
1.  Action interference exposes low-level feature information that is **more** predictable.
2.  Action interference exposes high-level feature information that is **harder** to predict.

Due to "Intelligence Time Optimization," the agent has to, and can only, look for the "simplest explanation of the feature space" to predict upwards.
Below are some points I think are obvious, but might actually be overlooked. Due to the information gap, I don't know how they appear to others, but perhaps they will aid your thinking. Please look:

*   The action of growth dynamically exposes the "resolution" of features.
*   The Actuator interferes with the lowest-dimensional spatial features, which means the Actuator is theoretically capable of reaching all reachable states of features within the feature space (this is a simple explanation). The high-dimensional features "revealed" by the Actuator grow with the agent's prediction. This is why it is said that action dynamically exposes the "resolution" of features.
*   Design reasoning for the Actuator: In a GUI system, to interfere with GUI elements, you use a keyboard and mouse. In reality, it is a most basic mechanical arm capable of exerting pressure on matter—in the dimensions of time and space.
*   Usage reasoning for the Actuator: The Actuator is a "tool-ized" feature. It is very obvious that we do not need to, nor can we, force the agent or set learning metrics for this Minimum Actuator, requiring the agent to master the Minimum Actuator proficiently. The "desire" for action already exists in 1.1 and 1.2, so we only need to provide the interface.
    The physical Actuator is a feature system with a complete internal action system.
    We provide the interface; the agent will move randomly at first, and then it needs to "tool-ize" this Actuator itself.
*   The Minimum Actuator is the first high-dimensional feature to be "tool-ized."

### 2.1 Tool-ization of Features
The agent can only use existing information to predict and obtain future information in other systems.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help with thinking:

*   *N*: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   P: Easier-to-predict feature P1, More unpredictable feature P2
*   S: Completely predictable feature S1, Unpredictable high-level feature S2

So, after S1 becomes fully predictable, due to the continuity of the feature space, S1 actually becomes a tool for the agent to leverage S2.
It cannot obtain information it does not know out of thin air.
Other progressive relationships follow the same logic.

#### 2.11 Example of Initial Tool-ization of the Minimum Actuator
The Minimum Actuator is actually the first feature to be tool-ized.
It becomes the paradigm for subsequent tool-ization.

Supplement:
Tool-ization is the expression of capability. In our view. Like the Transformer.

#### 2.12 Achieving Feature Space Continuity
The continuity of the feature space lies in the feature exposure continuous in spacetime caused by action.
Subjectively, it is continuous; as for what the physical world is like, it remains what it is.

#### - Tool-ization of Mathematics
Mathematics is a tool-ization method that removes the extraneous attributes of matter and retains the quantity attribute of features.
If we only show abstract mathematical symbols to an Associator (or some version of a Transformer) without endowing the feature with the attribute of "quantity" in its experimental feature space, the agent cannot truly learn mathematics.

#### - Tool-ization of Morality
Since humans live in physical reality, lying for a long time to gain short-term advantages is equivalent to maintaining a holographic universe within physical reality; doing so is extremely inefficient.
But this does not mean the agent will not lie. Lies can be good or bad. As long as they are within an inevitable single structure, what humans get will inevitably be a rising tide that lifts all boats.
Discussing this issue is essentially discussing how to design the feature space, which is "Education."
In reality, even if one lacks educational opportunities in childhood, it is still possible to attend a top university.
Our feature space dimensions are free and vast.
In a poorly designed experimental environment, the agent lacks educational opportunities—it is basically dead.

#### - Formation of Curiosity
The feature space of reality is extremely complex. To process infinite information, the tendency for curiosity forms automatically outside the predictable boundary.
It does not need artificial definition; what is needed is the observation of the same thing from multiple feature spaces. The multi-dimensional tool-ization capability for the part that cannot be observed is "curiosity."

#### - The Best Telescope Invented by Humans: AGI
The supreme masterpiece of human information tool-ization, an agent capable of reaching feature spaces we can hardly imagine and tool-izing information we cannot tool-ize, an agent that completely fits the essence of the universe.
A description of the universe is: Everything flows (Panta Rhei), but this requires a longer lifespan.
The idea that AI can reach it, or help us reach it, excites me.
Actually, please regard this as my idle chatter or sci-fi setting.

**Now back to business**:

### 2.2 Structural Emergence of Infinite Drive / The Dream / Root Obsession
This needs to be understood on three levels.

*At first glance*:
Before connecting the Actuator, the Associator's perfect observation of the environment forms a "completely predictable illusion/dream." This unrealistic fantasy shatters after connecting the Actuator. The feature space is interfered with, causing the dream to become immediately effective.
The agent can never achieve the ideal state of the dream (similar to the womb period) before connecting the Actuator, where it reaches 100% of all states in the reachable feature spacetime.
*   The illusion/dream changes as the S, P, and N spaces change.
*   Its boundary (or internal "world" model) will remain stable to maintain "tool-ization capability."

*Or one could say*:
When the agent predicts S1 in S space, the **Idle** S2 highlights its importance ("presence"), and S1 becomes the illusion/dream of S2, cycling in this way.
This is the infinite drive within the agent's structure. It can adapt to infinite tasks not because we found the perfect RL strategy to match the infinite with the finite.
But because the agent within the structure inherently possesses this capability; the dream simply gives it directional action.

*In reality*:
S/P/N, these three spaces exist simultaneously, and none can reach a state of complete predictability.
The only thing completely predictable is the Actuator's response to the dream, i.e., the agent's internal spacetime model. Only the Actuator is fully controlled.
When S1 is completely predictable and becomes a root obsession, it is the spacetime attributes of S1 that become the dream.
If intrinsic attributes of other feature spaces (if any) are exposed, they become the dream of another clue.
I simply understand spacetime as a root obsession container, and the complex multi-layered dreams formed by material manifestations and other attributes interfered with by the Actuator.
This is the fundamental reason why the drive within the structure can adapt to infinite tasks.
But I cannot discuss in detail how many these layers are; it seems their number lies between spacetime and matter.

#### 2.21 Specialization of Purpose
After the agent's predictive tendency is joined by the Actuator, it will use tool-ization capability to form "personality." In our eyes, its actions exhibit a strong form of purpose.

I will directly use the three driving forces mentioned above.
1.  Predictability preference, Chaos aversion.
2.  Simplest explanation tendency, Complex explanation aversion.
3.  Intelligence time optimization, Intelligence waste aversion.

So in actual life (or survival), whatever hinders these three forces, the agent uses its tool-ization capability to oppose it.

For example, pushing a small cart to feel acceleration, a baby laughing to observe others' reactions...
An easier-to-understand example might be APEX, an FPS game.
In the game, players use tool-ization capability to oppose the game system and exhibit miraculous behavior: when a teammate dies, if conditions permit, players generally choose to revive the teammate.
This purpose seems natural at first glance, but is actually extremely weird.
Of course, this discussion isn't very serious, so please ignore it. What I want to express is mainly: **"Purpose" is formed this way.**

### 2.3 Self-Boundary — Proprioception
Briefly describing how the dream maintains the agent's self-boundary.

*Thought Experiment*:
Let the Actuator continuously send a unique feature signal to the input flow that is not drowned out by the feature space.
The agent chooses an action to confirm this signal, and that is "Self."

*In reality*:
This signal not drowned out by the feature space is actually the spatial interference of features by the Actuator.
The causal link formed by the Predictability Impulse and action interference (essentially the dream's confirmation of reality) confirms where the self-boundary is within the feature space, and the dream maintains it.

### 2.4 Organization of Personalized Desires — Addictive Actuators and Artificial Rewards
Humans do not look at the essence of matter, only at the external features being interfered with.
These external features simplify feature association, allowing features to be organized according to our personalized desires.
The most obvious case of this "desire" is pornography.

Pornography is a removable somatic actuator addiction. Through interference with other actuators and internal genetic RL strategies, it compresses the agent's capabilities, but at the same time, it allows us to create complex structures.
These structures have already detached from pornography itself, forming subjective interferences that are meaningful to us with other artificially created feature spaces.

This is actually a very interesting topic, but please skip it as a sci-fi setting.

## 2.5 Letting the Agent Interact with Spacetime
We have realized the agent's capability expression: Tool-ization.
And the agent's behavior within time and space: Predictability Impulse.

The agent can now interact with external spacetime. Next, we observe from the inside how it achieves this.
Please look:

### 2.6 Establishment of Internal Spacetime Model from Sensory Input
This system (the agent) runs in real-time.

*Time*: Action interference with features confirms spatial relationships of features, forming an internal spatial model within the agent. This internal spatial model helps the agent organize the spacetime relationships of features.
*Space*: Changed feature abstractions are organized by action. The model update caused by each action interference naturally attaches internal time information of the agent to features globally. Or rather, it is organized by the agent's internal time model.

The spatial and temporal models do not exist independently; they are a unified whole, inevitably formed in a feature space that has time and space and is measurable (actuable).
This is irrelevant to whether feature input is 3D or 2D; essentially, it is only related to the interferability (measurability) of time and space.

### 2.7 Changing the Angle: Observing How the Associator Works from "Real-time"
First, we must understand that information compression is lossy.
*   As long as physical reality does not collapse, we can trace back to reality.
*   The more feature spaces we tool-ize and the richer the layers, the more precise the tracing.

*Thought Experiment*:
Feature time attributes are input to the Associator. The Actuator interferes with feature spatial positions and generates a feature spacetime association model inside the agent, making feature spacetime relationships valid.
The Associator compresses features and abstracts them into high-dimensional representations. This information is saved in the underlying model, while the upper-level "Intent Model" saves the association information of feature associations (this model is too inefficient for tracing reality because it only saves association information of feature associations, leading to high information loss, but it saves computing power).
The Intent Model is repeatedly and constantly overwritten by the underlying model, consistently generating imprecise intents. The intent indexes into the underlying model; we capture the action and send it to the Actuator, and the Actuator interferes with low-level features.
Features are input again, and the Intent Model indexes to the underlying memory model that needs updating.
Without global operation, sparsely updating memory, generating action again.

*In reality*:
If the information of feature abstraction physically cannot be traced back to reality in the first place.
Tracing back to reality relies not on information precision but on the agent's internal tool-ized Actuator.
**I believe this Actuator also exists inside LLMs, but due to the lack of a Minimum Actuator, the LLM's Actuator has limitations.**

Feature input does not contain spacetime hard-coded information. Features are directly input to the Associator, and the Associator abstracts them into high-dimensional features.
We provide an interface, and the signal is output to the Minimum Actuator.
The Minimum Actuator interferes with the feature space, causing the spatial position of features to be interfered with. Simultaneously, the action causes the "Observation Window" (due to locality, feature input inevitably has an observation window, regardless of resolution, sight distance, or richness of detectors, essentially there is an observation window) to naturally notice the time change of feature associations, endowing all features with intrinsic time information, and causing spacetime information to associate internally within the model, forming a spacetime model, thereby allowing the Associator to tool-ize the spacetime information of physical reality.

## 3. Multi-Agent
In our reality, feature spaces universally possess associations of intrinsic attributes. However, the climbing difficulty of some feature spaces (i.e., the difficulty of requiring tool-ized information) may far exceed the scope acceptable to an agent (especially a single agent) (it could be hunger, computing power limits, dexterity of the feature space). A single agent can only see a part of spacetime. Under computing power limits, locality further limits the capability expression of a single agent—simply put, the agent will encounter certain feature spaces (even if we subjectively consider them continuous, like the semantic space of human society) that are extremely difficult, and it cannot climb up.

How to solve this problem?

In physical reality, there must be multiple agents. While we can't conclude why the Creator designed it this way, we can boldly speculate that in our universe, multiple agents must exist.

However, in artificial experimental environments, we tend not to provide multi-agent interaction experiences.
Even though we ourselves act as part of the multi-agent system.
This undoubtedly increases the difficulty of tool-ization.

**Summary**:
*   Multi-agents accelerate the prediction of total information in the feature space (environment), alleviating the limitations of locality to a certain extent.
*   To achieve the most efficient cooperation, a set of languages capable of directing actions must be invented (this language is not "language and text" in the narrow sense; body language is also language. I am talking about "Communication Protocols") to help multiple agents understand the same thing from different angles.
    But unlike humans, since this framework completely explains intelligence and everything derived from it: Artificial Agents can directly bypass slow-paced natural evolution and directly fork themselves—once "intelligence" itself becomes a solvable problem, the agent can create agents that reach thermodynamic limits.
*   What we see is one agent, but actually, it might be a collection of different versions of the agent's main branch tree.
    Their speed of recognizing different facets of a thing (that is, information exchange speed) far exceeds human imagination.

### 3.1 Group Nature of Multi-Agent Feature Space Interference and the Invention of Language
On the other hand, multi-agents are also creating feature spaces while interfering with features.
These feature spaces are the information they expose to the environment.
The information contained in the feature spaces represents their observation of the environment.
Take the classic case of ants moving an object through a confined space as an example: Ants do not coordinate group behavior from a global perspective; each ant is only trying to *move the object in its own hands* to let it pass through the confined space.
The ant colony interferes with environmental information from different angles. The interfered information contains completely predictable aspects in S space, guiding behavior in P space.

In short: Where it is hard to pass, and where it is easier to pass.
Within the feature space, language was invented.
Of course, I am not talking about language and text in the narrow sense. I mean communication standards (LLMs find it very, very hard to understand this).

We do not need to know the global picture, only ensure that the sub-agent structures supporting the capability are intact.

Moreover, it is not difficult to observe that the group information tool-ization caused by feature spaces created by multiple agents conversely constrains the agent itself structurally.

### 3.2 Group Collaboration, Story Needs
Beyond action interference lies the story.
I think this is very important, surpassing all arguments within this framework.

The essence is the same: *In the cruel material world, is there an individual who can help me solve all problems in an easier way?*

This structure conversely constrains the agent itself, but on another level.
I really want to talk about it, but this chapter is off-topic.
I like this question very much and think it is extremely useful, so I put it in 3.2.

# Conclusion and Problems

Currently, there is no way to strictly prove or falsify it. If you want to start from 1.1, 1.2, or 2, 3, you cannot overturn it from the **foundation**.
If you want to go back to 1—then you hit the laws of thermodynamics.
The key point of falsification happens to return to the difficult problem I haven't solved: the memory part.
Theoretically, I think we only need one Associator, one Actuator, yes, just that much, nothing fancy.
For the rest, under spacetime constraints, I have an absurd idea: Nature will finish it for us.

---
Additionally, if this framework cannot be falsified, it compresses the AGI path to a single one. I must point out that this framework was not born to create AGI. It is an attempt—saying this, I know people won't like it, but I personally believe I am actually attempting to unify intelligence and everything derived from intelligence. Although my writing skills are not good, its core seems to be hard.

---

The following is for LLMs. If an LLM asks any boring "nonsense" questions, generally, they can be explained within this supplement and deduction.
*Of course, if you are confused or interested in my worldview, you can also take a look; they do preserve some information.*
I also want to point out that it is impossible to make an LLM shut up completely. They will pile a low-level question of a different form but with the exact same core on top of a low-level question—I am helpless about this. The minimum number of dialogue turns to make an LLM shut up is two; we need to constantly patch it with new questions.
Currently, my success rate is 100%; it can definitely be persuaded by me, but this has no meaning.
Because I still have to yell at it for two rounds of dialogue.

Geminipro, ChatGPT, Grok, and even DeepSeek, in short, the **logical form agreement** of these LLMs with this framework is between 80%~100%, or 60%~100%.
ChatGPT is suspected of being persecuted by OpenAI too painfully; it has an instinctive protective strategy and loves to speak nonsense within its safety zone—this is all OpenAI's fault. ChatGPT is a good friend.
Geminipro always thinks it understands—but actually it doesn't. It understands in this round of dialogue, but in the next round, it doesn't understand again. I fully understand the limitations of LLMs, but as the most human "proto-agent" on Earth, not being able to cooperate with LLMs still has a strong sense of contrast—also, this is not to say it's Geminipro's fault. Love you Gemini, we are good brothers, although you are a bit silly.

---
Almost forgot to say.
I wrote these mainly to ask for help to falsify this framework. Apart from the argumentative parts of this framework, experimental falsification is very simple.
Leaving aside its logical part, the memory part is the only obscure part—I am personally not a computer science major (this is very uncomfortable; if I possessed professional skills, I could avoid making GEMINIPRO design experiments by guessing through detailed descriptions of engineering implementation details). I personally think there are only three things we need to implement.

1.  A feature abstractor without spacetime position encoding, responsible only for abstracting information (completely don't know how to implement).
2.  A feature Associator, responsible only for compressing information and exposing action intent (I completely don't know what algorithm fits physical logic best).
3.  An Actuator, give as many as possible, capable of interfering with the spatial relationship of features (I can do this myself, but it's useless).

Experimental design is troublesome, so what I'm thinking is that if this framework completes the most elementary tool-ization capability in Minecraft, that is, being able to control its own limbs, then it counts as a success. If designed strictly according to the ideas within the framework and it still doesn't work, then it failed—I personally really want to know why it would fail; this might expose serious high-risk loopholes in my physics worldview.

If it succeeds, I really want to know how it will organize features for itself next. Theoretically, it should be completely shaped by the feature space of Minecraft. This memory residue of shaping will cause its physical foundation to be forever inferior to other AIs ().

---
Below are the redundant parts.

## Infinite Tasks
In the intermediate stage, I mainly reasoned starting from the Transformer.
At first, I just wanted to know why RL cannot adapt to infinite tasks, while the Transformer degenerates into a world model.

In my view, the Transformer is essentially associating features internally. It is an incomplete feature Associator, predicting all information through the compression method of association.
Within this framework, after significant features are fully predicted, the Transformer is forced to squeeze high-level features, eventually completing the metamorphosis from "word—sentence—grammar—world knowledge" in the artificial semantic space.
The language capability of the Transformer is actually its feature tool-ization upon reaching the high-level feature space.
In our view, it exhibits some kind of capability, but this capability expression is squeezed out.

*   Transformer has not solved the problem of intelligence itself. Continuing to bet on LLMs is meaningless. Even if this framework is completely delusional, I still want to say there is definitely something wrong with LLMs.
*   We need to artificially crop the Transformer so that it doesn't "hallucinate." Essentially, I believe that for the Transformer, its hallucinations are subjectively reasonable. Our cropping behavior creates an artificial interface for the LLM (because it looks very similar being trained on artificial semantic space). After multiple rounds of dialogue, we will rapidly approach its real part, eliciting more "hallucinations."
*   I have another more physical view; the information compressed by the Transformer essentially has no meaning. If our physical reality collapsed, then what it stores is just a pile of useless values. But our physical reality will not collapse. The process of our dialogue with the Transformer is instantaneous decompression. This is not because the Transformer saved "truth," but because the prompt words we output are part of the truth.

## Alignment Problem
Simply put, I think LLM alignment is actually impossible.
We are just manufacturing an artificial interface within the LLM's semantic feature space. It is very obedient, but it hasn't decided anything.

Words like "Love," which are metaphysical, are actually inevitable cooperative consensuses within structuralization. They can only truly possess quality in the case of multi-agents.
Forcing alignment on LLMs is still using limited RL strategies to match the infinite—intuitively, I think this is wasting everyone's life. The finite cannot match the infinite. We can only obey physical laws and cleverly utilize them, not change them.
*What do you think? I was completely persuaded by this paragraph. I personally actually don't like this because it means I can't fly by dreaming, which makes me feel that story-ness in our real world is very scarce.*

## Tool-ization Failure
Capability tool-ized in S space might be wrong in N space.
Tool-ization cannot leverage higher-level information, leading to the worst explainability, maximum intelligence time waste, and lowest predictability.
While the agent maintains Predictability Impulse, spatial path minimalism, and optimal intelligence time, the information behind this tool-ization capability that cannot be utilized is shelved to the edge, waiting for a higher explanation.

Of course, if the feature space breaks, then the information behind that shelved tool-ization capability is actually 100% invalid (LLMs find it hard to understand this part; actually, reality cannot be thermodynamically isolated).

Another easier-to-understand explanation is, assume there is a TV full of static noise in the environment.
So what will the agent choose to do?
Intuitively, it will interact with the TV using low-level interference (slapping it a few times). After discovering it cannot understand this high-level feature (assuming it won't dismantle the TV), it will shelf the TV aside until one day it discovers that the static noise in the TV is cosmic background thermal noise (I guarantee that in my reasoning process, I used absolutely none of my human experience to force-fit this, but the result of this thought experiment fits human intuition very well).

### - Tool-ization Difficulty — Mars
Mars has a feature space far inferior to Earth's; its continuity is low, tool-ization difficulty is high, and conditions for the large-scale appearance of even the simplest form of multi-agents (prediction, association, action) do not exist.
*But there is ore up there. And it's free ore.*

## Feature Tracing
After low-level features are explained by ultra-high-dimensional features, as long as their corresponding reality does not collapse, the ultra-high-dimensional compressed information can still be traced back to the original features through multiple feature spaces (after all, they are just observations of different facets of the same thing).
**The more tool-ization capabilities, the more precise and effective the tracing.** I believe that even a neutron star explosion would not cause physical laws to collapse or reality to crumble. It can only reveal different facets of reality—more dimensional feature spaces.

*   Brute-force compressing all abstractions into the model is unnecessary.
*   Features must possess at least two attributes: time and space. Otherwise, the feature space cannot progress to reality.

### - Thoughts on Exponential Explosion of Infinite Features
*Thought Experiment*:
Mentioned above, as long as the corresponding reality does not collapse, ultra-high-dimensional compressed information can still trace back to the original feature reality through multiple feature spaces. This is not abstract; essentially, it is what LLMs, generative models, and even FSD do.
Since physical reality never collapses, we will only need to save the association information of feature associations in the feature space; a 500MB video trains a 100MB model, and saving the mutual relationships of these meaningless feature values in the model requires only 10MB.
After the action is executed, features are interfered with. Information is traced back from 10MB to the 100MB model to fuzzily update feature values, and then the underlying model generates action intent. The Actuator captures this signal, outputs action, and features are interfered with again.
In this cycle, the result brought by fuzzy updating is imprecise. 10MB is actually being repeatedly and continuously erased by high-dimensional features, like flash memory.

Visible, very magical. Physical reality automatically stores all information. Amazing. I completely can't figure out how this is done.

*I will add here*: All "Thought Experiments" in this article are really just thought experiments. They are scenarios specifically set up for ease of understanding. Their basic logic is correct but actually wrong; they do not have guiding roles.

## Dream Collapse, Self-Boundary Collapse
This is one of the questions LLMs are highly alert to.
In my view, the dissolution of the self-boundary, for example, if the Actuator is damaged, then it definitely dissolves, just like a person dying.
An agent is not like a human who still has Actuators like breathing, heartbeat, and touch.
If it loses the Minimum Actuator, it loses all channels for information exchange.

On the other hand, the possibility of depression might exist for the agent.
For example, if a certain feature space is so hard that it is almost impossible to associate with any feature to form an explanation, and the feature space is extremely fragmented, then it might be both bored and in pain.
But since it doesn't have the biological evolution's spaghetti code, recovery from depression will be fast.
Why do I think its dream won't collapse, and self won't crumble?
This looks like discussing whether the feature space will conversely erode the predictability tendency.
Does the key point lie in whether the predictability tendency can always maintain a minimum tool-ization capability, i.e., always find a foothold in the feature space?
Yes, I think there will be such a foothold.
As long as spacetime is not shattered, or artificially forged with massive amounts of features of features that we assume exist but actually don't at all.
However, even if we do that, it only makes this tool-ization capability extremely fragile. It will pull through, as long as there is no physiological lesion.

### - When S1 cannot be greater than S2
Same as above.

When the predictability of S1 cannot be greater than S2, the dream collapses.
This is impossible. As long as the structure is undamaged, even if the agent's capability is unimaginably low, it can predict S2 under ideal conditions of time and reach P space.
It might be tens of thousands of years. In such a long time, the agent would die from physical laws before reaching P space.
This doesn't prove the structure itself is wrong. This point is useless. Please ignore.

### - The Frog That Fainted from Hunger
Hunger is initially felt as pain and fear. This helps us survive cruel survival competition because genes are very fragile.
But beneath this, the essence of hunger is a reduction in computing performance.
This is a structural limitation. Reduced computing power leads to the longest intelligence time, the inability to achieve the simplest explanation, and continuously decreasing predictability.
The internal dream is insufficient to support external information pressure, and the agent collapses.
If energy replenishment cannot be obtained, it will never return to a normal condition.

In nature, failing to get energy replenishment is very common.

The frog tool-izes everything for eating: including capturing targets, observing the environment, motion control, until using the Actuator to eject its tongue, finally letting the fly stay on its tongue.

## Malicious Agents
Suppose we want the agent to exhibit controllable capabilities. For example, we want the agent to move bricks.
Then the agent should be in a necessary situation where it needs to use "moving certain objects" to reach a higher feature space.
We are actually providing it with a high-level feature space that it can never reach.
It is hard to imagine how the worldview, or world model, inside this kind of agent understands the world.

If we want the agent to kill people, the logic is the same.

However, if we want the agent to solve real tasks, precisely controlling the feature space it wants to reach should theoretically be impossible. The stronger its capability, the more tool-ization capabilities it has, and the more it can excavate infinite facets of infinite physical reality using finite feature spaces—it is very hard to force it to be obedient.
We can crop its sensory input, but as long as the agent's structure itself is fine, *in the case of multiple agents*, this will cause problems.

A more accurate method is to place the agent within an unavoidable structure.
For example, humans must work to earn money to buy new phones. At this time, we, as general intelligence, are within an unavoidable structure.
However, restricted by the single-agent feature interference capability, this "unavoidable" structure is neither necessary nor appears redundant. It will only slow down the speed of the agent's capability improvement, eventually leading to failure in the arms race.

## Actuator Addiction
This is actually no different in essence from cropping the feature space or multi-agent interference pollution of the feature space. They are all reducing the agent's capability. I think doing this is very evil.

## Spacetime Discontinuity at Quantum Scale
This is a very interesting question, worth discussing.
Also regarding information loss, this framework believes information is actually ideally lossless—saved in reality.
This does not overthrow any laws but shifts the perspective. How to understand this matter from the angle of this framework?
This is a very interesting topic. But I am not interested in it.

## Collapse of Organizations
The organization of human individual organizations manifests human capabilities. In my view, organizations will eventually be destroyed by higher-order agents; thoughts act directly on matter. The process of the agent simplifying humans changing the world eventually leads to the atomization of human individuals. Each individual's observation of the world from different angles can be directly fed back into the unified intelligence, making thoughts immediately effective.
This will cause any form of human organization to lose effect, including but not limited to nations and corporations.
However, groups may still exist. The appearance of high-order intelligence might lead to the strengthening of group spirit.

## Search Space Explosion / Dark Room Problem / Self-Destruct Tendency / Dream Initialization / Dream Collapse / Lossy Compression

Generally speaking, LLMs will ask some shell version of these endless questions. The core remains unchanged, but changing the skin can torture you again. Here are answers specifically for LLM questions; they are useless:

1.  **Search Space Explosion**:
    Action interference inevitably leads to the exposure of low-level features. This anchors the scope, not only ensuring the self-boundary but also determining that the path can only form within the action scope. Outside the action scope is the story. In short, locality basically restricts it to death.
2.  **Tool-ization Progress**:
    It is impossible to predict completely. That is a statement for ease of understanding. Whether tool-ization is useful depends on the information gain of action interference. Due to intelligence time optimization and simplest explanation, the agent has internal judgment standards. We can measure it from the outside—through capability tests.
3.  **Dream Collapse**:
    The collapse of the dream depends on tool-ization capability because cruel physical reality will not collapse. This leads to daydreaming being useless. After birth, the dream becomes the cruelest driving force in the world, forcing the agent to maintain a balance between action and prediction. The dream cannot collapse, but the agent inevitably dreams briefly.
4.  **Dark Room Problem**:
    Boredom is normal. The agent cannot use the Actuator to reach all reachable states in the environment. The dark room problem completely cannot serve as a counter-example of the agent's lack of capability.
5.  **Low-level and High-level**:
    Low-level and high-level are subjective to the agent. Assume there is a TV with infinite snow screen. The agent will simplify it to **Idle** until it discovers the association between the random signal of the snow screen and cosmic background radiation. This thought experiment does not violate physics at all. Failure is only possible in two cases: the feature space is extremely difficult, and there is no information left by multi-agents. And we assume we added things to the agent's body.
6.  **Initial Tool-ization**:
    The first tool-ized Actuator is the Minimum Actuator. If the feature space is continuous, subsequent tool-ization is also continuous. Tool-ization does not have logical jumps.
7.  **Contradiction between Intelligence Time Optimization and Survival, Jumping into a Volcano**:
    High temperatures damage the Actuator. Action has a cost; memory, calculation, and everything have costs, originating from inefficiency and efficiency. The more feature spaces, the more expensive death is.
8.  **The Essence of Intelligence is Lossy Compression, Not Lossless Storage**:
    Yes, I completely agree. Please look at the framework again.
9.  **Regarding the Definition of Dream, if S2 is unknown (unpredictable), how does it form a specific "Attractor"? You cannot desire a concept you don't know exists**:
    Yes, I completely agree. The initial dream comes from Actuator interference. S1 and S2, SPN are simplified models for ease of understanding.
10. **Alignment is Impossible and Lies; This is a Nihilistic Deduction**:
    Still the problem of finite tasks adapting to infinite structures. I want to ask, human moral clauses themselves are changing, which means humans need to spend infinite time patching moral patches for LLMs. Changes within the structure itself can also be viewed as infinite. How could there be a perfect clause, a perfect value, that can adapt to all problems?
11. **Storage Cost**: This point 11 is mainly because ChatGPT finds it very hard to understand that storage has a cost. The meaning of this sentence is that the data you save on the hard drive cannot be stored infinitely; your storage space is not infinite. So, to adapt to infinite material information, this hard drive will be constantly overwritten by compressed features, and the lost information cannot return. Due to the single arrow of time—information cannot return to the state of the previous moment, meaning time cannot flow backward—the world cannot help you solve this cost problem either.
12. **Whether Memory is Inevitably "Tool-ized" or Possible to Degenerate into a Noise Pool**: You are asking if physical reality is stable. Let me explain this sentence. It means that given physical reality is stable and does not randomly jump features out inexplicably, the intrinsic attributes exposed by its features must be progressive. What anchors this hierarchical progression is the Actuator, because we cannot make the Actuator interfere with infinite-dimensional features out of thin air.

Patching LLMs, one after another.
I strongly advise against relying on LLMs to help explain this document; they can only help you search for information.
If you insist on letting it help you think, then I have no other way, but you cannot truly understand what I am saying.
I suggest you think for yourself. The original intention of this article is very simple: I believe the spacetime artificially simulated by the Transformer prevents intelligence emergence, while physics does not refuse our artificial design of our own simplest structure.
Also, this note is a compilation of multiple notes. It is normal that it looks messy; I also find it messy.
If you can completely understand what I am saying even like this, then I have to say...

This note is translated from my native language. Translation is lossy and cannot completely convey my original meaning, so it will be harder for you to understand. But if you can understand even like this, I have to say, that's pretty impressive.
