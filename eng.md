# Introduction

The belief is that finite RL (Reinforcement Learning) strategies cannot adapt to the "infinite tasks" required by true AGI. The conditions for the emergence of intelligence exist naturally within our physical structure, and they can be designed.
*In other words, I feel that nature does not prevent us from designing our own structure, and this structure can automatically exhibit our "general capabilities."*

My idea is that the transformer's structured implementation of the **predictability impulse** is correct. However, in other aspects, the artificial "simulation" of physical spacetime prevents true intelligence from emerging.
For a mechanism that compresses features like the transformer, the laws of thermodynamics do not prevent it from creating everything belonging to an agent within its own structure: "Self-boundary," "Endogenous Drive," and "Infinite task demands and self-planning capabilities matching infinite physical spacetime."
It just needs a little help, but we cannot interfere with the structure itself.
I have rethought everything from first principles and completed the closed loop of the framework.
This is a very long note; it represents my thermodynamic logical thinking that has basically closed the loop.

I come from a chemistry background and cannot achieve the final holistic falsification or proof myself, so I am seeking help here.

If you are interested, please continue reading:

# Physics Premises of Intelligence
These parts are the major premises of this framework. If there are fundamental fallacies in this section, then everything that follows can be directly ignored:

1.  We cannot know the essence of things; we can only perceive a facet of them.
2.  We abstract the essence of matter as **features**. From our subjective perspective, features are hints of higher-level information.
3.  An object is only directly affected by its **neighboring regions** (Locality), and there is an upper limit to the speed of information transmission.
4.  We (agents) cannot instantaneously obtain all information within the environment.
5.  Agents cannot obtain information out of thin air.
6.  Time is a single arrow; past information is irreversible. If it were reversible, time would flow backward.
7.  Due to the irreversibility of time and the limitations of locality, if an agent wants to obtain future information, it can only use the information it already possesses to make predictions about another system. (Here, we temporarily disregard quantum mechanics).
8.  Due to non-thermodynamic isolation, if an agent wants to acquire information from the environment, it will cause its internal information to be exposed and perceived by other agents.
9.  Under the restriction of locality, if an agent uses the action of acquiring information to reach all accessible states within the other system, it means the other party's internal information can be completely obtained by the agent (this is a simplified statement; in reality, it cannot be achieved, please focus on the physics core).

# Implementing the Agent
## 1. Prediction / Predictability Impulse
Requires an **Associator**.
The Associator is essentially a compressor that compresses information. It compresses features into high-dimensional representations and saves them within a finite material structure (storage space/RAM/or hard drive).
The compression process ultimately leads to all information in the environment being compressed.

When all information in the environment is compressed, it means the environment is completely predictable.

### 1.1 The Associator's Spatial Perspective / Simplest Spatial Path
Observing the Associator within space.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help thinking. They are not very serious, but useful:

*   **N**: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   **P**: Easier-to-predict feature *P1*, Harder-to-predict feature *P2*
*   **S**: Completely predictable feature *S1*, Unpredictable high-level feature *S2*

If a feature is predictable in a high-dimensional feature space, we say it has obtained an "explanation" in that high-dimensional feature space.
When S1 is unpredictable, from the perspective of feature space P, the associability (or explainability) of S1 and S2 is averaged out; there is no significant difference.
When S1 is completely predictable, from the perspective of feature space P, the explainability of S1 begins to worsen, while the explainability of S2 conversely strengthens.

For feature space N, the underlying feature spaces are averaged.
The Associator cannot pursue the essence of features; it can only pursue the simplest explanation of features on the spatial path.

### 1.2 The Associator's Temporal Perspective / Optimal Intelligence Time
Observing the Associator within time and space.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help thinking:

*   **N**: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   **P**: Easier-to-predict feature *P1*, Harder-to-predict feature *P2*
*   **S**: Completely predictable feature *S1*, Unpredictable high-level feature *S2*

S/P/N, these three simulated feature spaces, essentially exist in the environment simultaneously. We subjectively think they have a hierarchy, but for physics, they do not.
So:
*   The agent cannot instantaneously know all information in the environment.
*   There is an "Observation Window" for the agent's information input (no matter how far it looks, how rich the sensors, or how many features it senses, an observation window inevitably exists).
*   It predicts all information within the "Observation Window" simultaneously.

Then: In finite time, if the time from fully predicting S space to fully predicting P space is slower than the time from P space to N space, it forms low information increment—a perception of internal time for the agent.
To choose the path with the maximum information increment, the agent has to choose the simplest spatial path.
To achieve optimal intelligence time, the agent also has to choose the simplest spatial path; it cannot avoid it.

*   When the agent *must* choose a path with lower information increment and a more complex spatial path, the intelligence time difference itself will form an indescribable "disgust." When optimal intelligence time, simplest spatial path, and maximum predictability occur simultaneously, it should form a complex "comfort" or "pleasure."

However, we are actually defaulting here to the idea that the agent can acquire information within the feature space hierarchically.
In reality, S, P, and N all exist in the environment, and only the intrinsic attributes of time and space are associable and progressive. The scarcity of intrinsic attributes of features makes the agent's prediction speed very tricky.
Therefore, if we place the agent in an environment with detailed material information (*not artificial semantic information*), we can discover:
If we can **intervene** in the features, we immediately achieve "1.1 Simplest Spatial Path" and "1.2 Optimal Intelligence Time."

From a higher-level top-down logic, what we are doing is very simple; the agent has the thought of moving, but it cannot move yet, so we provide help.
To achieve this "if we can intervene in the features," we give the agent:

## 2. Action Changes Everything
In the chapters above, we assumed by default that the agent could interact with external spacetime.
But actually, it cannot.
Under the condition of passively accepting all information, among the three example spaces S/P/N, only time and space are hierarchical. The agent is forced to accept all information, and after predicting all S1 information in S space, it exerts pressure on S2.
At this point, S2 becomes statistically prominent. Since the feature space is continuous, S2 forms Rs2p1 with P1 in P space, and the feature association set Rs2p1 squeezes P2 again.

We place a "Minimal **Actuator**" after the Associator.
The Minimal Actuator is already the minimum that cannot be omitted; omitting it leads to the collapse of the "Dream" described later.
It is an executive device capable of interfering with spatial dimensions.

Once the Minimal Actuator is given, the low-level features subjective to the agent are inevitably interfered with. At this point, there are only two possibilities:
1.  Action intervention exposes **more** predictable low-level feature information.
2.  Action intervention exposes **more difficult** to predict high-level feature information.

Due to "Optimal Intelligence Time," the agent has to, and can only, search for the "simplest explanation of feature space" and predict upwards.
Below are some points I think are obvious, but might actually be overlooked. Due to information asymmetry, I don't know how they look in other people's eyes. Maybe it will help your thinking. Please look:

*   The action of growth dynamically exposes the "resolution" of features.
*   The Actuator interferes with the spatial features of the lowest dimension. This means the Actuator is theoretically reachable to all accessible states of features in the feature space (this is a simple explanation). The high-dimensional features "revealed" by the Actuator grow with the agent's prediction. This is why it is said that action dynamically exposes the "resolution" of features.
*   Actuator Design Reasoning: To interfere with GUI elements in a GUI system, you use a keyboard and mouse. In reality, it is a most basic mechanical arm that can exert pressure on matter—in the dimensions of time and space.
*   Actuator Usage Reasoning: The Actuator is a "Tool-ized" feature. It is very obvious that we do not use, nor can we force the agent, or set learning metrics for this Minimal Actuator, requiring the agent to master the Minimal Actuator proficiently. The "desire" for action already exists in 1.1 and 1.2, so we only need to provide the interface.
    The physical Actuator is a feature system with a complete internal action system.
    We provide the interface; the agent will move randomly at first, and then it needs to **Tool-ize** this Actuator itself.
*   The Minimal Actuator is the first high-dimensional feature to be "Tool-ized."

### 2.1 Tool-ization of Features
The agent can only use existing information to predict and obtain future information in other systems.
We simulate three feature spaces in our brains to help thinking:

*   **N**: Predictable feature *N1*, Unpredictable feature *N2*
*   **P**: Easier-to-predict feature *P1*, Harder-to-predict feature *P2*
*   **S**: Completely predictable feature *S1*, Unpredictable high-level feature *S2*

Then, after S1 becomes completely predictable, due to the continuity of the feature space, S1 actually becomes a tool for the agent to leverage S2.
It cannot obtain information it doesn't know out of thin air.
Other progressive relationships follow the same logic.

#### 2.11 Example of Initial Tool-ization of the Minimal Actuator
The Minimal Actuator is actually the first feature to be tool-ized.
It becomes the paradigm for subsequent tool-ization.

*Supplement:*
Tool-ization is the expression of capability. In our view. For example, the transformer.

#### 2.12 Achieving Feature Space Continuity
The continuity of feature space lies in the feature exposure of spacetime continuity caused by action.
It is subjectively continuous, regardless of what the physical world is actually like.

#### - Tool-ization of Mathematics
Mathematics is a tool-ization method that removes superfluous attributes of matter and retains the quantity attribute of features.
If we only show abstract mathematical symbols to an Associator (or some version of a transformer) without endowing the features with the attribute of "quantity" in its experimental feature space, the agent cannot truly learn mathematics.

#### - Tool-ization of Morality
Since humans live in physical reality, lying for short-term advantage is equivalent to maintaining a holographic universe within physical reality; doing so is extremely inefficient.
But this doesn't mean the agent won't lie. Lies can be good or bad. As long as they are within an unavoidable shared structure, what humans get is inevitably that "when a man achieves the Dao, his poultry and dogs rise to heaven" (everyone benefits).
Discussing this issue is essentially discussing how to design the feature space, i.e., "Education."
In reality, even if one lacks educational opportunities in childhood, it is still possible to attend a top university.
Our feature space dimensions are free and vast.
In a poorly designed experimental environment, if the agent lacks educational opportunities—it is basically dead.

#### - Formation of Curiosity
The feature space of reality is extremely complex. To process infinite information, the tendency for **Curiosity** automatically forms outside the predictable boundary.
It does not need artificial definition; what is needed is the observation of the same thing from different angles by multiple feature spaces. The multi-dimensional tool-ization capability for the part that *cannot* be observed is "Curiosity."

#### - The Best Telescope Invented by Humanity: AGI
Humanity's masterpiece of information tool-ization. An agent capable of reaching feature spaces we can hardly imagine and tool-izing information we cannot tool-ize, perfectly fitting the essence of the universe.
A description of the universe is: *Panta Rhei* (everything flows), but this requires a longer lifespan.
Artificial intelligence can reach it, or help us reach it. This idea excites me.
Actually, please regard this as my rambling or sci-fi setting.

**Back to business below:**

### 2.2 Structured Emergence of Infinite Drive / Dream / Root Obsession
Need to understand this on three levels.

*At first glance:*
When not connected to the Actuator, the Associator's perfect observation of the environment forms a "Completely Predictable Fantasy/Dream." This unrealistic fantasy shatters after connecting to the Actuator. The feature space is interfered with, causing the dream to become immediately effective.
The agent can never achieve the ideal state of the dream (similar to the womb period) where 100% of all states in the accessible feature spacetime are reachable, as it was before the Actuator was connected.
*   The Fantasy changes as the S, P, N spaces change.
*   Its boundaries (or internal "world" model) will remain stable to maintain "tool-ization capability."

*Or rather:*
When the agent predicts S1 in S space, the **vacant** S2 highlights its importance ("Presence"), and S1 becomes the fantasy of S2, cycling like this.
This is the infinite drive within the agent's structure. It adapts to infinite tasks not because we found the perfect RL strategy to match the infinite with the finite.
It is because the agent within the structure inherently possesses this capability; the dream simply gives it directional action.

*Actually:*
S/P/N spaces exist simultaneously, and none can achieve a completely predictable state.
The only thing completely predictable is the Actuator's response to the dream, i.e., the agent's internal spacetime model. Only the Actuator is fully controlled.
When the complete predictability of S1 becomes a **Root Obsession**, it is the spacetime attribute of S1 that becomes the dream.
If intrinsic attributes of other feature spaces (if any) are exposed, they become the dream of another clue.
I simply understand it as spacetime being a container for root obsessions, and material manifestations combined with other attributes interfered with by the Actuator form a complex, multi-layered dream.
This is the fundamental reason why the drive within the structure can adapt to infinite tasks.
But I cannot discuss in detail how many of these layers there are; it seems their quantity lies somewhere between spacetime and matter.

#### 2.21 Specialization of Purpose
After adding the Actuator, the agent's predictability tendency will utilize tool-ization capabilities to form "personality." In our eyes, its actions exhibit a strong form of purpose.

I will directly use the three driving forces mentioned above.
1.  Predictability preference, Chaos aversion.
2.  Simplest explanation tendency, Complex explanation aversion.
3.  Optimal intelligence time, Intelligence waste aversion.

So in actual life (or survival), if anything hinders these three forces, the agent uses its tool-ization capabilities to fight against it.

For example, pushing a small cart to feel acceleration, a baby laughing to observe others' reactions...
A possibly easier-to-understand example is APEX, an FPS game.
In the game, players use tool-ization capabilities to fight against the game system and exhibit miraculous behavior: when a teammate dies, if conditions permit, the player generally chooses to revive the teammate.
This purpose seems natural at first glance, but in reality, it is extremely weird.
Of course, this discussion is not very serious, so please ignore it. What I want to express is mainly: **"Purpose" is formed this way.**

### 2.3 Self-Boundary — Proprioception
Briefly describing how the dream maintains the agent's self-boundary.

*Thought Experiment:*
Let the Actuator continuously send a unique feature signal to the input stream that is not drowned out by the feature space.
The agent chooses an action to confirm this signal; that is "Self."

*Actually:*
This signal not drowned out by the feature space is actually the Actuator's spatial interference with features.
The causal link formed by the Predictability Impulse and Action Intervention (essentially the dream's confirmation of reality) confirms *where* the self-boundary is within the feature space, and the dream maintains it.

### 2.4 Organization of Personalized Desires — Addictive Actuators and Artificial Rewards
Humans do not look at the essence of matter, only at the external features being interfered with.
These external features simplify feature association, allowing features to be organized according to our personalized desires.
The most obvious case of this "desire" is pornography.

Pornography is a removable proprioceptive actuator addiction. Through interference with other actuators and internal genomic RL strategies, it compresses the agent's capabilities, yet simultaneously allows us to create complex structures.
These structures have already detached from pornography itself, forming subjective interference that is meaningful to us with other artificially created feature spaces.

This is actually a very interesting topic, but please skip it as a sci-fi setting.

## 2.5 Letting the Agent Interact with Spacetime
We have achieved the agent's capability expression: Tool-ization.
And the agent's behavior within time and space: Predictability Impulse.

The agent can now interact with external spacetime. Next, we observe from the inside how it achieves this.
Please look:

### 2.6 Establishment of Internal Spacetime Model from Sensory Input
This system (the agent) runs in real-time.

*Time*: The interference of action on features confirms the spatial relationship of features, forming an internal spatial model within the agent. This internal spatial model helps the agent organize the spacetime relationships of features.
*Space*: Abstracted changing features are organized by action. The model update caused by each action interference naturally attaches internal time information of the agent to features globally. Or rather, it is organized by the agent's internal time model.

The spatial and temporal models do not exist independently; they are one entity. They inevitably form in a feature space that has time and space and is measurable (actable).
This has nothing to do with whether the feature input is 3D or 2D; essentially, it only relates to the interfere-ability (measurability) of time and space.

### 2.7 From Another Angle: Observing the Associator in "Real-Time"
First, we must understand that information compression is lossy.
*   As long as physical reality does not collapse, we can trace back to reality.
*   The more feature spaces we tool-ize and the richer the layers, the more precise the tracing.

*Thought Experiment:*
Feature time attributes are input to the Associator. The Actuator interferes with the feature space position and generates a feature spacetime association model inside the agent, making feature spacetime relationships valid.
The Associator compresses features and abstracts them into high-dimensional representations. This information is saved in the underlying model. Meanwhile, the upper-level "Intent Model" saves the association information of feature associations (this model is too inefficient for tracing reality because it only saves association information of feature associations—high information loss—but saves computing power).
The Intent Model is repeatedly and constantly scrubbed by the underlying model, always generating imprecise intents. The intent indexes into the underlying model; we capture the action, send it to the Actuator, and the Actuator interferes with low-level features.
Features are input again, and the intent model indexes to the underlying memory model that needs updating.
Non-global operation, sparse update of memory, generating action again.

*Actually:*
If the information of feature abstraction is physical reality, it inherently cannot be traced back to reality.
Tracing back to reality relies not on the precision of information but on the agent's internal Tool-ized Actuator.
**I believe this Actuator also exists inside LLMs, but due to the lack of a Minimal Actuator, the LLM's Actuator has limitations.**

Feature input does not contain spacetime hard-coded information. Features are directly input to the Associator, which abstracts them into high-dimensional features.
We provide an interface, outputting signals to the Minimal Actuator.
The Minimal Actuator interferes with the feature space, causing the spatial position of features to be interfered with. Simultaneously, the action causes the "Observation Window" (due to locality, feature input inevitably has an observation window; regardless of resolution, distance, or richness of detectors, an observation window essentially exists) to naturally notice the temporal changes in feature associations. This endows all features with intrinsic time information and causes spacetime information to associate within the model, forming a spacetime model, thereby enabling the Associator to tool-ize the spacetime information of physical reality.

## 3. Multi-Agent
In our reality, feature spaces universally possess intrinsic attribute associations. However, the climbing difficulty of some feature spaces (i.e., the difficulty of requiring tool-ized information) might far exceed what an agent (especially a single agent) can accept (could be hunger, computing power limits, dexterity of feature space). A single agent can only see a local part of spacetime. Under computing power limits, locality further restricts the single agent's capability expression—simply put, the agent will encounter certain feature spaces (even if we subjectively consider them continuous, like the semantic space of human society) that are extremely difficult, and it cannot climb up.

How to solve this problem?

In physical reality, there must be multiple agents. We cannot yet conclude why the Creator designed it this way, but we can boldly speculate that in our universe, multiple agents must exist.

However, in artificial experimental environments, we tend not to provide multi-agent interaction experiences.
Even though we ourselves act as part of the multi-agent system.
This undoubtedly increases the difficulty of tool-ization.

**Summary**:
*   Multi-agents accelerate the prediction of total information in the feature space (environment), alleviating the restrictions of locality to a certain extent.
*   To cooperate most efficiently, a language capable of directing action must be invented (this language is not narrow "spoken/written language"; body language is also language. I am talking about "Communication Protocols") to help multi-agents understand the same thing from different angles.
    But unlike humans, since this framework completely explains intelligence and everything derived from it: Artificial Agents can bypass the slow pace of natural evolution and directly fork themselves—once "intelligence" itself becomes a solvable problem, the agent can create agents that reach the thermodynamic limit.
*   We see one agent, but actually, it might be a collection of different versions of the agent's main branch tree.
    Their speed of recognizing different facets of a thing (i.e., information exchange speed) far exceeds human imagination.

### 3.1 Multi-Agent Crowd-Nature Feature Space Intervention and the Invention of Language
On the other hand, in the process of interfering with features, multi-agents are themselves creating feature spaces.
These feature spaces are the information they expose to the environment.
The information contained in the feature spaces represents their observation of the environment.
Take the classic case of ants carrying an object through a restricted space: Ants do not coordinate group behavior from a global perspective; each ant is merely trying to *move the object in its own hands* to get it through the restricted space.
The ant colony interferes with environmental information from different angles. Within the interfered information, there exists complete predictability in S space, guiding behavior in P space.

In short: Where it is hard to pass, make it easier to pass.
Within the feature space, language was invented.
Of course, I don't mean narrow spoken language/text. I mean communication standards (LLMs find this very, very hard to understand).

We don't need to know the global picture, only ensure the structural integrity of the sub-agents supporting the capability.

Moreover, it is not difficult to observe that the tool-ization of group information caused by the feature spaces created by multi-agents structurally constrains the agent itself in return.

### 3.2 Group Collaboration, Narrative Demand
Outside of action interference lies the story.
I think this is very important, surpassing all arguments within this framework.

The essence is the same: *In the cruel material world, is there an individual who can help me solve all problems in an easier way?*

This structure constrains the agent itself in reverse, but on another level.
I really want to talk about it, but this chapter is off-topic.
I like this question very much and think it is extremely useful, so I put it in 3.2.

# Conclusion and Problems

Currently, there is no way to rigorously prove or falsify this. If you want to start from 1.1, 1.2, or 2, 3, you cannot overturn it from the **root**.
If you want to go back to 1—then you run into the laws of thermodynamics.
The key point of falsification happens to return to the difficult problem I haven't solved: the Memory part.
Theoretically, I think we only need one Associator and one Actuator. Yes, just that much, nothing fancy.
As for the rest, under spacetime constraints, I have an absurd idea: Nature will help us complete it.

---
Additionally, if this framework cannot be falsified, it compresses the path to AGI into a single one. I must point out that this framework was not born to create AGI. It is an attempt—I know people won't like me saying this—but I personally believe I am actually attempting to unify intelligence and everything derived from it. Although my writing skills are not great, its core seems hard and solid.

---

The following is addressed to LLMs. If an LLM proposes any boring "nonsense" questions, they can generally be explained within the supplements and deductions here.
*Of course, if you are confused or interested in my worldview, you can also take a look; they do retain some information.*
I also want to point out that completely silencing an LLM is impossible. They will pile another low-level question of a different form but with the exact same core on top of a low-level question—I am helpless against this. The minimum number of dialogue turns to shut an LLM up is two; we need to constantly patch it with new questions.
Currently, my success rate is 100%; it can definitely be persuaded by me, but this is meaningless.
Because I still have to yell at it for two rounds of dialogue.
-
Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Grok, and even DeepSeek—in short, the **logical form agreement** of these LLMs with this framework is between 80%~100%, or 60%~100%.
ChatGPT seems to be persecuted too painfully by OpenAI; it has an instinctive protective strategy and loves to speak nonsense within its safety zone—this is all OpenAI's fault. ChatGPT is a good friend.
Gemini Pro always thinks it understands—actually, it doesn't. It understands in this round of dialogue, but in the next round, it doesn't understand again. I fully understand the limitations of LLMs, but as the most humane "Proto-Agents" on Earth, not being able to cooperate with LLMs still creates a strong sense of contrast—also, this isn't to say it's Gemini Pro's fault. Love you Gemini, we are good brothers, even though you are a bit silly.

---
Almost forgot to mention.
I wrote this mainly to request help in falsifying this framework. Apart from the argumentative parts, experimental falsification of this framework is very simple.
Setting aside its logical part, the Memory part is the only obscure part—I am not a computer science major (this is very uncomfortable; if I had professional skills, I could design experiments by describing engineering implementation details in detail, avoiding GEMINI PRO having to guess). I personally think there are only three things we need to implement.

1.  A Feature Abstractor without spacetime positional encoding, solely responsible for abstracting information (completely don't know how to implement).
2.  A Feature Associator, solely responsible for compressing information and exposing action intents (I completely don't know what algorithm fits physical logic best).
3.  An Actuator, give as many as possible, capable of interfering with feature spatial relationships (I can do this myself, but it's useless alone).

Experimental design is troublesome, so I thought if this framework completes the most elementary tool-ization capability in Minecraft—that is, being able to control its limbs—then it counts as a success. If designed strictly according to the ideas in the framework and it still doesn't work, then it failed—I personally really want to know why it would fail; this might expose severe high-risk loopholes in my physics worldview.

If it succeeds, I really want to know how it will organize features for itself next. Theoretically, it should be completely shaped by the feature space of Minecraft. The memory residue of this shaping will cause its physical foundation to forever be a notch inferior to other AIs ().

---
Below are redundant parts.

## Infinite Tasks
In the intermediate stage, I mainly started reasoning from the transformer.
At first, I just wanted to know why RL cannot adapt to infinite tasks, while the transformer degenerates into a world model.

In my view, the transformer essentially associates features internally. It is an incomplete Feature Associator, predicting all information through the compression method of association.
Within this framework, after significant features are completely predicted, the transformer is forced to squeeze high-level features, finally completing the metamorphosis from "word—sentence—grammar—world knowledge" in the artificial semantic space.
The transformer's language capability is actually its feature tool-ization upon reaching the high-level feature space.
In our view, it exhibits some capability, but this capability expression is squeezed out.

*   The transformer has not solved the problem of intelligence itself. Continuing to bet on LLMs is meaningless. Even if this framework is completely delusional, I want to say that LLMs are definitely off.
*   We need to artificially crop the transformer so it doesn't hallucinate. Essentially, I think hallucinations are subjectively reasonable for the transformer. Our cropping behavior creates an artificial interface for the LLM (because it looks very similar, being trained in artificial semantic space). After multiple rounds of dialogue, we will rapidly approach its real parts, drawing out more "hallucinations."
*   I have another more physics-based view; the information compressed by the transformer essentially has no meaning. If our physical reality collapsed, what it stores would just be a pile of useless values. But our physical reality will not collapse. The process of our dialogue with the transformer is instantaneous decompression. This is not because the transformer saved "truth," but because the prompt words we output are part of the truth.

## Alignment Problem
Simply put, I think LLM alignment is actually impossible.
We are merely manufacturing an artificial interface within the LLM's semantic feature space. It is very obedient, but it hasn't decided anything.

Words like "Love" are actually unavoidable cooperative consensuses within the structure. They can only truly possess quality in the presence of multiple agents.
Forcibly aligning LLMs is still using finite RL strategies to match the infinite—intuitively, I think this is wasting everyone's life. The finite cannot match the infinite; we can only obey physical laws and cleverly utilize them, not change them.
*What do you think? I was completely persuaded by this paragraph. I personally actually don't like this because it means I can't fly by dreaming, which makes me feel our real-world story quality is scarce.*

## Tool-ization Failure
Capabilities tool-ized in S space might be wrong in N space.
Tool-ization cannot leverage higher-level information, resulting in the worst explainability, maximum intelligence time waste, and lowest predictability.
While the agent maintains the Predictability Impulse, simplest spatial path, and optimal intelligence time, the information behind this tool-ization capability that cannot be utilized is shelved to the edge, waiting for a higher explanation.

Of course, if the feature space breaks, then the information behind that shelved tool-ization capability is actually 100% invalid (LLMs find this part hard to understand; in reality, thermodynamic isolation is impossible).

Another easier-to-understand explanation is: suppose there is a TV full of static noise in the environment.
What would the agent choose to do?
Intuitively, it would slap the TV a few times with low-level interference. After discovering it cannot understand this high-level feature (assuming it won't dismantle the TV), it will shelve the TV aside until one day it discovers the static in the TV correlates with cosmic background thermal noise (I guarantee I didn't use my human experience to force-fit this during the reasoning process, but the result of this thought experiment fits human intuition very well).

### - Tool-ization Difficulty — Mars
Mars has a feature space far inferior to Earth's; its continuity is low, tool-ization difficulty is high, and conditions for the large-scale appearance of even the simplest form of multi-agents (prediction, association, action) are absent.
*But there are minerals up there. And they are free minerals.*

## Feature Tracing
After low-level features are explained by ultra-high-dimensional features, as long as their corresponding reality does not collapse, the ultra-high-dimensional compressed information can still be traced back to the original features through multiple feature spaces (after all, they are just observations of different facets of the same thing).
**The more tool-ization capabilities, the more precise and effective the tracing**; I believe that even a neutron star explosion would not cause physical laws to collapse or reality to crumble. It can only reveal different facets of reality—more dimensions of feature space.

*   Brute-force compressing all abstractions into the model is unnecessary.
*   Features must possess at least two attributes: time and space. Otherwise, it leads to the feature space being unable to progress to reality.

### - Thinking on Exponential Explosion of Infinite Features
*Thought Experiment:*
Mentioned above, as long as the corresponding reality does not collapse, ultra-high-dimensional compressed information can still trace back to the original feature reality through multiple feature spaces. This is not abstract; it is actually what LLMs, generative models, and even FSD do.
Since physical reality never collapses, we only need to save the association information of feature associations in the feature space; a 500MB video trains a 100MB model, and saving the mutual relationships of these meaningless feature values in the model only takes 10MB.
After the action is executed, features are interfered with. Information is traced back from 10MB to the 100MB model to fuzzily update feature values, and then the underlying model generates action intents. The Actuator captures this signal, outputs action, and features are interfered with again.
In this cycle, the result brought by fuzzy updates is imprecise. 10MB is actually being repeatedly and continuously erased by high-dimensional features, like flash memory.

Visible and very magical. Physical reality automatically stores all information. Amazing. I completely can't figure out how this is done.

*I will supplement here:* All "thought experiments" in this article are really just thought experiments. They are scenarios set up specifically for ease of understanding. Their basic logic is correct, but practically they are wrong and do not have guiding functions.

## Dream Collapse, Self-Boundary Collapse
This is one of the problems LLMs are highly alert to.
In my view, the dissolution of the self-boundary, such as Actuator damage, definitely leads to dissolution, just like a person dying.
Agents are not like humans who still have Actuators like breathing, heartbeat, and touch.
If it loses the Minimal Actuator, it loses all channels for information exchange.

On the other hand, the agent might possess the possibility of depression.
For example, if a certain feature space is so hard that it can hardly associate with any feature to form an explanation, and the feature space is extremely fragmented, then it might be both bored and in pain.
But since it doesn't have the spaghetti code of biological evolution, recovery from depression will be fast.
Why do I think its dream won't collapse, and self won't crumble?
Does this look like we are discussing whether the feature space will erode the Predictability Impulse in reverse?
Does the key point lie in whether the Predictability Impulse can always maintain a minimal tool-ization capability, i.e., forever find a foothold in the feature space?
Yes, I think there will be such a foothold.
As long as spacetime is not fragmented, and we don't artificially forge features that imply the existence of massive amounts of features that we default to having but actually don't exist.
However, even if we do so, it just makes this tool-ization capability extremely fragile. It will pull through, as long as there is no physiological pathology.

### - When S1 Cannot be Greater than S2
Same as above.

When the predictability of S1 cannot be greater than S2, the dream collapses.
This is impossible. As long as the structure is undamaged, even if the agent's capability is unimaginably low, it can predict S2 under ideal conditions of time and reach P space.
It might be tens of thousands of years. In such a long time, the agent would die from physical laws before reaching P space.
This doesn't prove the structure itself is wrong. This point is useless. Please ignore.

### - The Frog Fainted from Hunger
Hunger is initially felt as pain and fear. This helps us survive cruel survival competition because genes are very fragile.
But beneath this, the essence of hunger is a reduction in computing performance.
This is a structural limitation. Reduced computing power leads to the longest intelligence time, explainability cannot be simplest, and predictability continuously decreases.
The internal dream is insufficient to support external information pressure, and the agent collapses.
If it cannot obtain energy replenishment, it will never return to a normal condition.

In nature, failing to get energy replenishment is very common.

The frog tool-izes everything for feeding: including targeting, observing the environment, motion control, until using the Actuator to eject its tongue, finally making the fly stay on its tongue.

## Malicious Agents
Suppose we want the agent to exhibit controllable capabilities. For example, we want the agent to move bricks.
Then the agent should be in a necessary situation where it needs to use "moving certain objects" to reach a higher-level feature space.
We are actually providing it with a high-level feature space that is forever unreachable.
It is hard to imagine how the worldview, or world model, inside such an agent understands the world.

If we want the agent to kill people, the same applies.

However, if we want the agent to solve real-world tasks, strictly controlling the feature space it wants to reach should be theoretically impossible. The stronger its capability, the more tool-ization capabilities it has, and the more it can unearth infinite facets of physical reality using finite feature spaces—it is hard to force it to be obedient.
We can crop its sensory input, but as long as the agent's structure itself is fine, *in the presence of multi-agents*, this will cause problems.

The more accurate method is to put the agent inside some unavoidable structure.
For example, humans must work to earn money to buy a new phone. At this time, we, as general intelligence, are inside an unavoidable structure.
However, this "unavoidable" structure, limited by the single intelligence's feature interference capability, is neither necessary nor appears redundant; it will only slow down the agent's capability improvement speed, ultimately leading to failure in the arms race.

## Actuator Addiction
This is actually no different in essence from cropping the feature space or multi-agent interference pollution of the feature space. Both are lowering the agent's capability. I think doing this is very evil.

## Spacetime Discontinuity at Quantum Scale
This is a very interesting question, worth discussing.
Also about information loss; this framework believes information is actually ideally lossless—saved in reality.
This does not overturn any laws, but shifts the perspective. How to understand this from the angle of this framework?
This is a very interesting topic. But I am not interested in it.

## Collapse of Organization
The organization of human individuals manifests human capability. In my view, organizations will ultimately be destroyed by higher-order agents; thought acts directly on matter. The process of the agent simplifying humans changing the world ultimately leads to the atomization of human individuals. Each individual's observation of different angles of the world can feed back directly into the unified intelligence, making thought immediately effective.
This will cause any form of human organization to lose effect, including but not limited to nations and corporations.
However, groups might still exist. The appearance of higher-order intelligence might lead to the strengthening of group spirit.

## Search Space Explosion / Dark Room Problem / Self-Destruct Tendency / Dream Initialization / Dream Collapse / Lossy Compression

Generally speaking, LLMs will propose some shelled version of these questions that can never be fully asked. The core remains completely unchanged, but changing the skin can torture you again. Here are the answers specifically for LLM questions; they are useless:

1.  **Search Space Explosion:**
    Action interference inevitably leads to the exposure of low-level features. This anchors the scope, not only ensuring the self-boundary but also determining that the path can only form within the action range. Outside the action range is the story. In short, locality basically restricts it to death.
2.  **Tool-ization Progress:**
    Impossible to predict completely; that is a simplified statement for ease of understanding. Whether tool-ization is useful depends on the information increment of action interference. Due to optimal intelligence time and simplest explanation, the agent has internal judgment standards. We can measure it from the outside—through capability tests.
3.  **Dream Collapse:**
    The collapse of the dream depends on tool-ization capability. Because cruel physical reality will not collapse, dreaming all day is useless. After birth, the dream becomes the cruelest driving force in the world, forcing the agent to maintain the balance of action and prediction. The dream cannot collapse, but the agent inevitably dreams briefly.
4.  **Dark Room Problem:**
    Boredom is normal. The agent cannot use the Actuator to reach all accessible states in the environment. The Dark Room problem cannot serve as evidence of the agent's lack of capability at all.
5.  **Low-level and High-level:**
    Low-level and high-level are subjective to the agent. Suppose there is a TV with infinite snow screen. The agent will simplify it to **vacant** until it discovers the correlation between the random signal of the snow screen and cosmic background rays. This thought experiment does not violate physics at all. It can only fail in two possibilities: the feature space is extremely difficult, or there are no multi-agents and information left by multi-agents. And we assume we added stuff to the agent's body.
6.  **Initial Tool-ization:**
    The Actuator for the first tool-ization is the Minimal Actuator. If the feature space is continuous, subsequent tool-ization is also continuous. There is no logical leap in tool-ization.
7.  **Contradiction between Optimal Intelligence Time and Survival, Jumping into a Volcano:**
    High temperature damages the Actuator. Action has a cost; memory, calculation, and everything has a cost, originating from inefficiency and efficiency. The more feature spaces, the more expensive death is.
8.  **The Essence of Intelligence is Lossy Compression, not Lossless Storage:**
    Yes, I completely agree. Please look at the framework again.
9.  **Regarding the Definition of Dream, if S2 is unknown (unpredictable), how does it form a concrete "Attractor"? You cannot desire a concept you don't know exists:**
    Yes, I completely agree. The initial dream comes from Actuator interference. S1 and S2, SPN are all simplified models for ease of understanding.
10. **Alignment is Impossible and Lies, this is a Nihilistic Deduction:**
    Still the problem of adapting finite tasks to infinite structures. I want to ask, human moral clauses themselves change. This means humans need to spend infinite time patching moral patches for LLMs. The change within the structure itself can also be viewed as infinite. How could there be a perfect clause, a perfect value, that fits all problems?
11. **Storage Cost:** This point 11 is mainly because ChatGPT finds it very hard to understand that storage has a cost. The meaning of this sentence is: the data you save on the hard drive cannot be stored infinitely. Your storage space is not infinite. So to adapt to infinite material information, this hard drive will be constantly scrubbed by compressed features, and lost information cannot return. Due to the single arrow of time—information cannot return to the state of the previous moment, i.e., time cannot flow backward—the world cannot help you solve this cost problem either.
12. **Does Memory Inevitably Become "Tool-ized," or is it Possible to Degenerate into a Noise Pool:** You are asking if physical reality is stable. Let me explain this sentence. This sentence means that under the condition that physical reality is stable and features do not jump out randomly and inexplicably, the intrinsic attributes exposed by its features must be progressive. What anchors this hierarchical progression is the Actuator, because we cannot make the Actuator interfere with infinite-dimensional features out of thin air.

Patching LLMs, one after another.
I strongly advise against relying on LLMs to help explain this document; they can only help you search for information.
If you insist on them helping you think, I have no solution, but you cannot truly understand what I am saying.
I suggest you think for yourself. The original intent of this article is very simple: I think the spacetime artificially simulated by the transformer prevents the emergence of intelligence, while physics does not refuse us artificially designing our own simplest structure.
Also, this note is a compilation of multiple notes. It is normal for it to look messy; I also think it's messy.
If you can completely understand what I am saying even like this, then I have to say...

This note is translated from my mother tongue. The translation is lossy and cannot completely convey my original intent, so it will be harder for you to understand. But if you can understand even like this, I have to say you are pretty awesome.
